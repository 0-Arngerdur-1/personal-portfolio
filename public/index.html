        Hi! üëã<br />
        <br />
        I'm <u>Edwin Alvarado</u>, a web developer passionate about technology
        and learning

          <p>Currently seeking full-time opportunities.</p>
          <p>
            As a web developer I enjoy creating both front-end web pages with a
            modern, minimalist and somewhat laid-back touch with the goal of
            being a responsive design. I also like being behind the scenes on
            the backend using technologies like the databses to feed the
            frontend.
          </p>
          <p>
            In each new project I like to set new challenges to overcome in
            order to improve my programming skills and get out of my comfort
            zone.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, I'm probably reading or watching some random
            video or learning to play an instrument or setting new goals.

              >Contactore</a
            >
            <p>
              A web application to store contacts and write pendings for each
              contact.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this application you can add contacts, edit contacts, search
              contacts and delete contacts. The form has validations for
              different fields, for example, so that the phone number agrees to
              the 10 digits required, email validation and validation of
              required fields.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is the project that cost me the most effort and time since I
              had to install the tools, configure them, install the framework
              and do the programming logic, but in each of these steps I went
              through several installation, configuration and code problems. To
              such a degree of thinking that programming was not my thing, but I
              didn't give up, I kept going and was able to finish it even with
              improvements that I didn't have planned at the beginning.
